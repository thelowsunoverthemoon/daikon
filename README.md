## Usage

**radish** is created as a CMD "extension" to be used by Batch Script in games. It provides the most basic features needed in games such as audio and mouse / keyboard input that are somewhat difficult in Batch. Unlike other .exes that provide similar functionality, **radish** does NOT need to be called every time it is needed. It runs along with the Batch script and provides features in Batch terms like environment variables and macros.
